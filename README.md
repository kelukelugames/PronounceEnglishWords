Help me improve english

Future work:
 1. I use google.com for the sound files, but google doesn't support all common words. Need to find a source that has more words.
 2. Spellchecker and a way to detect words without sound files. I think I can use jQuery to check if the mp3 file is present.
 3. Right now I use two text files, but I want to move to Google drive. Not sure if this is easy using http APIs.
 4. A way to edit the word lists directly.
 5. Make it into an app? Add recording?
